# RNN-LSTM based Model
This file contains RNN-LSTM python code written using keras.
The original code is taken from [FPGA-Based-LSTM-Accelerator](https://github.com/JerrytTom/FPGA-Based-LSTM-Accelerator). 
In order to run the code, you should upload your stock exchange dataset and you can create your own model 

After generating the model you can parse it to see Bias, Kernel (Weights), Recurrent Kernel (Hidden Matrix) using our python code [HERE](https://github.com/DHLSan/TradeNIC/blob/main/LoadingModelUDP/H5fileSender.py)
or you can download [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5_tools/)

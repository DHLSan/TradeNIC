## LSTM-Zynq-Only
This file contains the Dense and LSTM layer of implementation in C programming language. Under the src folder you can find all the kernel and bias values of sp500.csv file and compile it with using lstm.h.
Lstm.h header file includes all the LSTM gate calculations under the lstm function. You can implement to any C compiler and try.
The output values you expect to see are normalized values you should consider the drop rates
* ! Don't forget to increase Heap and Stack size of your application project.
